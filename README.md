# Attendence-Assistant
Attendence Assistant app helps students track their attendance. This is only a fun app which was the first android app made by me when i was learning Android App Development.

App uses - SQLite Database, ListViews, ListAdapters, CursorAdapters, GoogleMaps API, LocationManager and Manymore! The app was coded in 2017 so android features used are according to that
